    <h1>Code Breaker</h1>
    <p>As an international sneak thief, you break into vaults all the time. <br>
        Riddling out a simple 3 digit code is child's play for you. <br>
        But you must be getting sloppy in your old age because you've tripped an alarm. <br>
        In no time at all, the police will be all over the place. <br>
        Can you get into the vault before they arrive?<br>
    </p>
